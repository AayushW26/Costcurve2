    """
    Get Amazon product data using Keepa's free tier
    Perfect for student projects with 100 requests/month
    """
    
    # Free Keepa API key (sign up at keepa.com)
    API_KEY = "YOUR_FREE_KEEPA_API_KEY"
    
    # Search for products
    search_url = "https://api.keepa.com/query"
    params = {
        'key': API_KEY,
        'domain': '8',  # Amazon India
        'type': 'product',
        'term': query,
        'sort': 'RELEVANCE_LAUNCH_DATE',
        'range': f'0-{max_results}'
    }
    
    try:

        data = response.json()
        
        print(f"‚úÖ API calls used this month: {data.get('tokensLeft', 'Unknown')}")
        
        products = []
        for product in data.get('products', []):
            products.append({
                'title': product.get('title'),
                'asin': product.get('asin'),
                'current_price': product.get('stats', {}).get('current', [None])[0],
                'amazon_url': f"https://www.amazon.in/dp/{product.get('asin')}",
                'image': product.get('imagesCSV', '').split(',')[0]
            })
        
        return products
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return []

# Example usage for student project
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test with just 3 products to save API calls
    results = get_amazon_product_data("laptop", max_results=3)
    
    for product in results:
        print(f"üì± {product['title']}")
        print(f"üí∞ Price: ‚Çπ{product['current_price']/100 if product['current_price'] else 'N/A'}")
        print(f"üîó {product['amazon_url']}")
        print("-" * 50)
```

### **Option 2: Amazon Affiliate API (100% Free)**
