## 🔍 Testing Your Setup

### 1. Backend Health Check
Open: http://localhost:5000/health
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Cost Curve API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-26T...",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Frontend Application
Open: http://localhost:3000

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### MongoDB Connection Issues
```bash
# If you see MongoDB connection errors:
# 1. Make sure MongoDB is running:
mongod

# 2. Or update the connection string in backend/.env:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/costcurve
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# If port 3000 or 5000 is busy:
# Frontend will automatically use next available port
# Backend: Update PORT in backend/.env
```

### Package Installation Issues
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall:
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Database**: Your MongoDB is configured and ready
2. **Environment**: All environment variables are set
3. **Development**: Both servers are running with hot reload
4. **Features**: Start building your price comparison features!

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Backend runs on **port 5000** with nodemon (auto-restart on changes)
- Frontend runs on **port 3000** with React dev server (hot reload)
- CORS is configured to allow communication between servers
- Database models will be created automatically when first accessed
- Environment variables are loaded from `backend/.env`

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your Cost Curve development environment is fully configured and running. You can now:
- Make changes to React components (frontend hot reloads)
- Update API routes (backend auto-restarts) 
- Add new features and test them immediately
- Use the browser developer tools for debugging

Happy coding! 🚀
